# zsh + vim + pytorch workspace

This repository is my pytorch workspace.
The settings of zsh and vim came from https://dotfiles.wook.kr/.
Base image of this docker file is "pytorch/pytorch:[pytorch_version]-cuda[cuda_version]-cudnn[cudnn_version]-runtime".

This docker image is built automatically and the source github repository is https://github.com/wonkyunglee/docker.
Pull requests are always welcome.

# Verison
git tag is same as the base docker image of pytorch version.
